# DESCRIPTION #


I designed an Augmented Reality (AR) furniture application interface that focuses on intuitive interaction and immersive user experience. The objective was to create a seamless AR interface that allows users to visualize furniture in their real environment before making a purchase decision. The design includes four primary screens: AR Home Screen, AR Camera Screen, Instruction Screen, and Save Design Screen.

The AR Home Screen provides a simple and minimal entry point with a clear “Start AR View” call-to-action, ensuring users immediately understand the primary function of the application. In the AR Camera Screen, users can place a 3D furniture object (e.g., sofa) into their physical space. The interface is kept clean to avoid distraction, allowing the AR object to remain the focal point. Essential controls are positioned ergonomically at the bottom for easy thumb access.

The Instruction Screen introduces gesture-based interactions such as drag to move, pinch to resize, and rotate with two fingers. These instructions are displayed clearly without overwhelming the user, ensuring intuitive onboarding for first-time users. Finally, the Save Design Screen enables users to take a screenshot or save their design, supporting sharing and decision-making processes.

The design emphasizes usability, clarity, spatial interaction, and minimal UI interference to maintain immersion. By applying principles of user-centered design, visual hierarchy, and gesture-based interaction patterns, the interface ensures an engaging, realistic, and easy-to-navigate AR experience.
